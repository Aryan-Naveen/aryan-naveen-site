Collaborated with my robotics team during the COVID season to help try to replicate an open source ventilator that the University of Florida had published. I was in charge of replicating the electronic assembly and getting the software to compile and load onto the arduino. Essentially, the electronic system you see wired in the images allowed control over duty cycle as well as target bpm. Given that we were working remote, I simulated the valves with light-bulbs.

The end product can be seen in the video below after several more iterations in terms of electronic packaging. Unfortunately the design from UF never got FDA approval and as a result this ventilator was not able to be used.
