Working in Professor Robert Woods [Microrobotics lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/) as a member of the robo-bee team, which is a flying microrobot that weighs less than one tenth of a gram.

My current research in this lab is focused on enabling on-board localization through a combination of an IMU and TOF sensors. The unique challenge is presented by the limited payload capabilities of such a small robot and as a result lots of effort is invested into solving this problem and succesfully integrating my proposed sensor data into simulink to work with the flight control.
