<h3> Career & Academic Interests </h3>

I am currently a undegraduate student at Harvard University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am extremely passionate about robotics and hope to pursue a career in the field. I am strongly motivated to participate in enabling robotics to achieve their potential that way if a robot takeover happens maybe they will spare me.

In particular, robotic perception is a field that I am greatly interested in as I believe the biggest obstacle to enabling greater functionality in automation and robotics is their ability to understand their surroundings. As a result, robotic sensing and computer visions are topics that greatly interest me as they apply to informing the robots actions.

<h3> Hobbies & Clubs </h3>

At Harvard I am a member of the [Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club (HURC)](https://harvardrobotics.com/) where we build and compete various robots. Furthermore, I am also involved in ultimate frisbee where I am in a leadership position for the club team (If you do some searching on youtube might find some sick highlights). Furthermore, I am also an active member in Harvard's Sports Analytics Collective where I have published 2 pieces as a part of the NFL subteam and competed in a hackathon for the milwuakee bucks,

Furthermore, I love sports and I am a die-hard Peyton Manning fan. You can check out this passion at the link below:
